## About

This is the official portfolio website for Marcos Paulo Coelho, a skilled 3D artist with a degree in architecture and experience in concept art, environment design, and architectural visualization (archviz). The portfolio includes a gallery of his works, a short biography, and contact information.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sophialaurans/3d-artist-portfolio.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd 3d-artist-portfolio
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

## Usage

Upon opening the `index.html` file, the homepage features a carousel showcasing the author's works, occupying the full viewport. The carousel cycles through images, each overlaid with the author's name, titles, and social media logos with links. At the bottom, an arrow allows scrolling to the portfolio start, or users can use mouse scrolling.

Scrolling down reveals a sticky navigation bar with links to "Portfolio," "About," and "Contact."

In the "Portfolio" section, users can switch between "Gallery" (a selection of images) and "Projects" (all images grouped by project). Hovering over a project image shows the project title and navigation arrows. Clicking an image opens a modal with a larger view, including a link to the project's ArtStation page. Keyboard arrow navigation is supported in the modal.

The "About" section includes a biography, lists of software expertise and skills, and social media links.

The "Contact" section provides the author's email and a contact form that uses Formspree to send messages.
